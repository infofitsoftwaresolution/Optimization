QMHP Dany met with Rachelle \"Shelley\" to work on her ID application

GIRPP Progress Note

Title of Curriculum Used: imr

IMR Curriculum: topic 10: getting your needs met by the mental health system

GIRPP Note Narratives

Intervention: QMHP Dany met with RACHELLE face-to-face at her residence to provide Psych Rehabilitation service coordination utilizing IMR topic 10. The QMHP Dany actively listened to RACHELLE and provided emotional support. QMHP Dany also attempted to create a Texas by Texas account as she stated that she has a driver's license; however, was unable to finalize the account creation due to the missing audit number. QMHP Dany additionally attempted to schedule an appointment for her ID, but RACHELLE was in a rush, stated that she wanted to sleep, and appeared tired.

Response: RACHELLE's appearance was appropriate, and her hygiene was fair. She appeared to be very tired and stated, \"I'm tired, I went to the meet from 12 to 1.\" RACHELLE reported that her mother had not mailed back the Release of Information (ROI) letter. She did not show any motivation for the visit; however, she was participating by providing her Social Security Number and Driver's License number to create her Texas Benefits account. Unfortunately, the account creation was incomplete due to the missing Audit number, which is required along with either the DL or ID. While attempting to schedule an appointment for her ID, she asked, \"How long will it take? Can we do it another day?\" RACHELLE reported feeling very tired and wanting to sleep. She also expressed a craving for smoking cigarettes, stating, \"I want to smoke.\" She decided to end the visit as she needed to rest.

Progress: Shelley has made progress by accepting to visit with us. 

Referrals: Not at this time.

Plan/Future Actions: ACT team will continue to follow up with RACHELLE by assisting her in scheduling her identification appointment and checking on her Snap benefits.
